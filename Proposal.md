## Summary

This proposal outlines a plan to improve FSI's internal operations by developing and implementing software to automate two key workflows: reserving conference rooms and reporting IT issues. By streamlining these manual processes, the office will be able to maximize efficiency, enhance communication, and maintain smoother day-to-day operations.

## Problem Statement

Currently, FSI personnel must reserve conference rooms by speaking directly with the front desk, and report IT issues informally through Microsoft Teams messages. These manual processes:

- Interrupt staff workflows and introduce delays
- Risk double-bookings or overlooked issues
- Provide no formal tracking or history

## Proposed Solution

Develop a system with:

- Conference Room Reservation Tool: A real-time booking form and calendar view of room availability
- IT Helpdesk Ticket System: A submission form with ticket status tracking (open, in progress, resolved)

## Development Phases

1. Planning – Document FSI's workflows and plan development
2. Design – Design user interfaces for booking and ticketing
3. Development – Implement backend logic and data storage as well as
4. Testing – Internal testing and usability improvements
5. Deployment – Launch the system and document usage
6. Maintenance – Add notifications, analytics, and keep up to date

## Technical Possibilities

Depending on existing systems, team preferences, and available support, the platform could be built using:

- Frontend Options: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla or Bootstrap for styling)
- Backend Options: Flask (Python), Django (Python), or Node.js
- Storage Options: SQLite, Google Sheets (via Apps Script), or MySQL
- Integration Options: Microsoft Graph API (for Teams/Outlook), SMTP (email notifications)

## Benefits

- Streamlined room booking with transparent availability
- Formalized IT support process with visibility and prioritization
- Reduced workload on front desk and IT
- Clear history of usage and recurring issues
- Hands-on project experience with real-world value
