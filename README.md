# FSI-automation

This project was something I though of during my time working at FSI.
The code and implementation are solely developed by me and are not official software from FSI. 

**Disclaimer:** This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by FSI.

## Features 
- Real-time conference room booking with a calendar view
- IT helpdesk ticket submission
- User-friendly interfaces and backend logic (Hopefully)
